🧙‍♂️ The Coding Cauldron: A Tech Stack & Development Journey 🏰✨  👉🏽 [ https://gabriela-chirinos.github.io/Coding_Couldron/ ]

I leveraged modern web technologies to create a fully responsive, visually engaging, and fun Harry Potter-themed website.

Inspired by the CUBE landing page.  [  https://preview.cruip.com/cube/index.html?ref=landingfolio ]

Frontend Framework: 🏗️ React.js – Used for component-based architecture, state management, and overall reusability.

Styling: 🎨 Tailwind CSS v4 – Ensured rapid, consistent, and responsive styling with utility-first classes.

3D Animations: 🌀 Spline – Used to create and embed interactive 3D elements, enhancing user experience.

Icons & UI Elements: 🔗 React Icons – Provided scalable, customizable icons for navigation and UI enhancements.

Version Control: 🔄 Git & GitHub – Managed source code with Git, ensuring proper commits and branch management.

🎭 The Creative Remix: Harry Potter Meets CUBE 🤓

This inspiration began with CUBE’s sleek, dark-themed landing page. It had all the essential modern UI/UX elements wanted: 

✅ Minimalist Design
✅ Floating Cards & Smooth Animations
✅ 3D Elements to Enhance Interactivity


Some fun twists added:
Hogwarts-themed elements in the UI: Instead of traditional testimonials, we brought in Wizarding World reviews from iconic characters.
Harry Potter icons instead of generic UI elements (e.g., Hogwarts crest, the Golden Snitch, wands, and more).


🌀 Implementing Spline’s 3D Elements (Challenges & Learnings)
One of the biggest learning curves in this project was integrating 3D models from Spline into React.

🔍 Challenge 1: Understanding Spline’s React Integration
Spline provides interactive 3D models, but importing them correctly into React wasn’t straightforward. I had to:

Install the Spline React package

🔍 Challenge 2: Making 3D Models Responsive
Initially, the 3D object took up too much space, especially on mobile devices. I had to:

-Use Tailwind’s responsive classes to control height & width.

-Apply object containment strategies to prevent overflow.

Experiment with scale and position properties in Spline to fine-tune size & perspective.

The final implementation looked like this:

    
📈 Other Key Insights & Development Learnings

📌 1. Mobile-First Approach
Prioritized responsiveness throughout the project.

Elements like:

-The navigation bar
-The hero section
-The testimonial cards
-The pricing & FAQ sections were all structured with mobile-first design principles.


🚀 Wrapping Up 

If we were to extend this project further, I could:

✅ Add parallax scrolling effects
✅ Include more Harry Potter-themed animations
✅ Implement user-interactive elements (e.g., wand gestures to trigger UI changes!)

This was a fun, hands-on build, and hopefully, it serves as a showcase of my skills for future projects! 🚀✨
